## Description
A Node Command Line Interface (CLI) that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. The app prompts the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns.  Once the user has completed building the team, an HTML file is created that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
